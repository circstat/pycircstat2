## Key Features

- **One-Stop Circular Data Analysis Pipeline with `Circular` Class**  

    The `Circular` class simplifies circular data analysis by providing automatic data transformation, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and visualization toolsâ€”all in one place.  

    ```python
    from pycircstat2 import Circular
    data = [30, 60, 90, 120, 150]
    circ = Circular(data, unit="degree")
    print(circ.summary())
    circ.plot(plot_rose=True, plot_mean=True)
    ```

- **Compatibility with Legacy APIs**  

  APIs for descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing follow the conventions established by the original [circstat-matlab](https://github.com/circstat/circstat-matlab) and [pycircstat](https://github.com/circstat/pycircstat), ensuring ease of use for existing users.


- **Wide-Ranging Circular Distributions**  

  The package supports a variety of circular distributions, including:  
  - **Symmetric distributions**: Circular Uniform, Cardioid, Cartwright, Wrapped Normal, Wrapped Cauchy, von Mises (and its flat-top extension), and Jones-Pewsey.
  - **Asymmetric distributions**: Sine-skewed Jones-Pewsey, Asymmetric Extended Jones-Pewsey, Inverse Batschelet.


## Installation
